This repository contains marketing assets and design files for Vineyard Technologies projects. While these are generally public-facing materials, we still maintain security best practices:

- No sensitive business information should be stored in this repository
- All assets should be properly licensed and attributed
- Access controls are maintained for proprietary design files
- Regular audits of stored content are performed
